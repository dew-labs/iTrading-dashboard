## Areas for Improvement

### Visual Hierarchy Issues

1. **Typography Scale**: Limited heading variations (only h1-h4)
2. **Content Density**: Cards could have better spacing and breathing room
3. **Color Hierarchy**: Status colors need better semantic mappings
4. **Icon Consistency**: Mixed icon sizes and styles across components

### Interactive Elements

1. **Button States**: Missing focus, active, and disabled state variations
2. **Card Interactions**: Limited hover feedback and click affordances
3. **Navigation**: Sidebar could have better visual feedback for active states
4. **Form Elements**: Basic styling without advanced interaction patterns

### Mobile Experience

1. **Touch Targets**: Some buttons may be too small for mobile
2. **Gesture Support**: No swipe or touch-specific interactions
3. **Navigation**: Mobile sidebar could be more intuitive
4. **Content Scaling**: Some dashboard cards don't scale well on mobile
